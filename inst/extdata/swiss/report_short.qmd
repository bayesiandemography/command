## Introduction

We examine predictors of fertility levels in nineteenth century Swizterland.

## Methods

We use a robust linear model to analyse provincial-level data.

## Results

Here are the coefficient estimates:
```{r}
#| echo: false
tab_coef <- readRDS("out/tab_coef.rds")
knitr::kable(tab_coef, digits = 2, caption = "Coefficients")
```

## Discussion

Fertility in Switzerland was positively correlated with agriculture and infant mortality.
