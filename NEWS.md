# command 0.1.3


## Documentation

* Tidied articles, and added detail on the way that `extract_make()`
  and `extract_shell()` treat dotted vs non-dotted arguments.

## Bug fixes

* Fixed bug in `extract_shell()`, `extract_make()`, `shell_script()`,
  and `makefile()` where the shell commands or Makefile rules created
  by these function used absolute paths to R scripts, rather than
  relative paths.


# command 0.1.2

* Expanded description and provided options to turn off messages.


# command 0.1.0

* Initial CRAN submission.
